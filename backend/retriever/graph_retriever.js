/**
 * graph_retriever.js — knowledge-graph side of RAG: query → entities → triples
 *
 * Runs in the request path next to retriever.js, deliberately: matching a query
 * against the graph is dictionary lookup plus two hops over ~24k edges, which is
 * microseconds in memory. Spawning Python per chat message to do it would cost
 * more in interpreter startup than the work itself.
 *
 * Query entities are found by GAZETTEER, not by NER. An off-the-shelf NER model
 * predicts PERSON/ORG/LOC and would not recognise 'band gap' or
 * 'Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof' at all, whereas the graph already knows every name it
 * can answer about. Cluster members are indexed alongside representatives, so a
 * query saying 'DFT' or 'NequIP' still finds the node those merged into.
 *
 * Expansion is TWO hops but refuses to travel through hub entities. Measured on
 * a 192-document corpus: unrestricted 2-hop from any single seed reaches 41-54%
 * of the corpus, and unbounded expansion reaches 99% — because 57% of the graph
 * is one connected component. Hubs are the cause ('machine learning' has degree
 * 399, in 60 of 192 papers), so they are allowed as seeds but never as
 * stepping stones.
 *
 * Triples are ranked by specificity × corroboration:
 *   specificity  idf = log(N / documents the seed appears in). A seed in 60/192
 *                papers barely narrows anything; one in 3/192 nearly names the
 *                paper. Measured spread: 1.16 to 4.16.
 *   corroboration  how many papers state the same triple. A weak signal in
 *                practice — measured, 98.9% of triples come from one paper —
 *                so it acts as a tiebreaker rather than a driver.
 *
 * Exports:
 *   buildGraphIndex(graph)                  — gazetteer + adjacency, built once per corpus
 *   matchSeeds(queryText, index)            — exact entity mentions in a query
 *   matchSeedsByEmbedding(spans, index, ..) — fallback for unmatched spans
 *   graphFacts(queryText, index, opts)      — ranked triples with their documents
